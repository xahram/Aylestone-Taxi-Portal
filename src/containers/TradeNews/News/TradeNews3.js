            <h1> Guide or assistance dogs </h1>
            <p><span>By Aylestone Taxis | September 19, 2019 </span></p>
			<p>	Guide dogs are working dogs not pets, their owners rely on them for both independence and mobility. The Equality Act 2010 places a duty on taxi and private hire drivers to carry guide dogs and other assistance dogs at no extra cost.</p>
			<p>Unless they have a medical exemption certificate, taxi and private hire drivers must:</p>
			<p>Carry the assistance dog in their vehicle and allow it to remain with its owner</p>
			<p>Not charge extra for carrying an assistance dog in their vehicle</p>
			<p>Private hire companies must not refuse a booking or refuse to carry out a booking due to someone having an assistance dog with them.</p>
			<p>Driver exemptions</p>
			<p>Drivers can apply to us for an exemption (certificate) from the duties to assist passengers in wheelchairs or with guide dogs, either on medical grounds or because their physical condition makes it impossible or unreasonably difficult for them to comply with the duties.
